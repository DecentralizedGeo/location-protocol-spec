The location protocol framework is designed to enable independent implementations to interoperate without sharing code, while remaining flexible enough to support Earth-based, metaverse, and symbolic digital location contexts. Built on the [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://attest.org/) (EAS), the Location Protocol framework provides a standardized way to create attestations for location data. It allows users to create, sign, and verify location attestations that can be used across different platforms and applications.

This repository contains core specifications for the Location Protocol framework, including:

[**Location Attestation**](./loccation-attestation/) - Defines the standard formatting and rules for generating location attestation objects.
